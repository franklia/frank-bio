        <p>For the past 6 years, whilst working in startups, I've also been learning code and building my own websites and apps. I am now looking to transition into programming full time.</p>
        <p>My tech career began in tech support, which allowed me to support myself whilst I built up my skill base. My current employer then offered me the opportunity to lead a project to rebuild one of our software platforms (WooBoard) as Head of Product. It was an amazing experience. In that role I managed two developers and thoroughly enjoyed delving deeper and more strategically into the tech.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m now at a stage where I would like to code full-time. Ultimately I would like to be a CTO and this is another step along that path.</p>

            <p>Like many others, I started with HTML, CSS and PHP, where I began building websites using WordPress themes and also created my first simple web app.</p>
            <p>From there I completed a 3 month Ruby on Rails night course at CoderFactory, where I built "Feedsta" (see portfolio) which integrates with the Instagram API.</p>
            <p>More recently I've been learning React, Node and Mongo. To help me learn I created "Spot Quiz" where I can pre-enter questions and test myself regularly.</p>
            <p>Fun fact: I also built this website using React.</p>

            <p>My first startup role was at Connect2Field providing tech support for a SaaS product in the fieldworker space. We grew quickly and I was soon recruiting and leading the support team. In the evenings I studied web development.</p>
            <p>Connect2Field was then acquired by a larger US firm and I experienced all that came with that process.</p>
            <p>Following a brief stint as a freelance web developer, I joined REFFIND as Tech Support Manager. We listed on the ASX four months later and went on a rollercoaster ride. Later I was given the opportunity to lead a project to rebuild one of our software platforms (WooBoard) as Head of Product.</p>

            <Typography variant="h5" color="inherit">Programming Skills</Typography>
            <p>I have built my own apps using HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap, JSON, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React and Node - see Portfolio. </p>
            <p>I've hosted these apps on Heroku and AWS, and also used Photoshop and Illustrator to create assets.</p>
            <p>I have strong SQL skills (both  MySQL and PostgreSQL) having used them on a daily basis in my previous role to diagnose customer issues, find bugs and run reports.</p>
            <p>Manual software QA testing (using the UI) is also an area I've had a lot of experience in.</p>

          <p>Although I'm seeking a developer role, that doesn't mean you can't take advantage of my other skills and experiences when required.</p>
          <p>I'm happy to share my knowledge in relation to UX / UI, design, feature scoping and product strategy.</p>
          <p>As someone who has worked across different business areas, I bring a circumspect view and can explain complex concepts in clear language to non-technical stakeholders</p>
