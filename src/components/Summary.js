        <p>I do not have a typical CV. </p>
        <p>I am a quietly determined individual and this has led me to some amazing opportunities, which I've taken. For the past 6 years, whilst working in startups, I've also been learning code and building my own web apps. I am now seeking to transition into programming full time. </p>
        <p>After reading my job history, you may think <span className={classes.italics}>WTF!? This guy is going backwards!</span> &nbsp;But youâ€™d be wrong. </p>
        <p>Few things are more valuable in a startup than knowing the code and the architecture of your app. I am willing to absorb some short term pain (financially) in order to achieve long term success. </p>
        <p>In my most recent role as Head of Product I managed a small development team and thoroughly enjoyed delving deeper into the tech. I am now seeking a junior full stack engineering role using modern technologies such as React and Node.</p>

            <Typography variant="h5" color="inherit">My Coding Journey</Typography>
            <p>Like many others, I started with HTML, CSS and PHP, where I began building websites using WordPress themes and also created my first simple web app.</p>
            <p>From there I completed a 3 month Ruby on Rails night course at CoderFactory, where I built "Feedsta" (see portfolio) which integrates with the Instagram API.</p>
            <p>More recently I've been learning React, Node and Mongo. To help me learn I created "Spot Quiz" where I can pre-enter questions and test myself regularly.</p>
            <p>Fun fact: I also built this website using React.</p>

            <p>My first startup role was at Connect2Field providing tech support for a SaaS product in the fieldworker space. We grew quickly and I was soon recruiting and leading the support team. In the evenings I studied web development.</p>
            <p>Connect2Field was then acquired by a larger US firm and I experienced all that came with that process.</p>
            <p>Following a brief stint as a freelance web developer, I joined REFFIND as Customer Support Manager. We listed on the ASX four months later and went on a rollercoaster ride. In an unlikely turn of events, I ended up in the CEO role for six months, prior to becoming Head of Product.</p>

            <Typography variant="h5" color="inherit">Programming Skills</Typography>
            <p>I have built my own apps using HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap, JSON, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React and Node - see Portfolio. </p>
            <p>I've hosted these apps on Heroku and AWS, and also used Photoshop and Illustrator to create assets.</p>
            <p>I have strong SQL skills (both  MySQL and PostgreSQL) having used them on a daily basis in my previous role to diagnose customer issues, find bugs and run reports.</p>
            <p>Manual software QA testing (using the UI) is also an area I've had a lot of experience in.</p>

          <p>Although I'm seeking a developer role, that doesn't mean you can't take advantage of my other skills and experiences if required.</p>
          <p>I'm happy to share my knowledge and experience in relation to UX / UI design, feature scoping, product strategy, and general startup strategy & operations.</p>
